I didn't figure out the proper format and bit order for the inputs and outputs
so I didn't make it a full SHA256 evaluation with proper padding and initial size,
but rather just evaluated the circuit in all zeroes and used it as test vector.
This might slightly impact the simplified circuit but shouldn't be too much.
